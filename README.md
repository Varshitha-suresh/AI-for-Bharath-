## 📌 Overview

AI Mentor is an AI-powered unified platform that combines:

- 🎓 Personalized learning  
- 💻 Intelligent code assistance  
- 📊 Adaptive progress tracking  

Built for the **AI for Bharat Hackathon (AWS)**, the platform bridges the gap between understanding technical concepts and applying them in real-world coding scenarios.

## 🎯 Problem

Most platforms focus either on:

- 📘 Learning (theory-based systems)  
- 💻 Developer tools (coding assistance)  

Very few integrate both into one intelligent ecosystem.

### Learners struggle to:
- Understand complex concepts  
- Identify weak areas  
- Apply learning practically  

### Developers spend time on:
- Debugging  
- Code optimization  
- Searching documentation  

---

## 💡 Solution

AI Mentor provides a unified AI system that integrates learning and coding intelligence.

### 🧠 AI Learning Assistant
- Explains concepts in adaptive language  
- Generates quizzes with instant feedback  
- Detects learning gaps  
- Recommends next topics  

### 💻 AI Code Assistant
- Generates code from natural language  
- Debugs and optimizes code  
- Performs automated code review  
- Suggests best practices  

### 📊 Progress Dashboard
- Tracks skill growth  
- Visualizes performance metrics  
- Provides personalized recommendations

## 🏗️ Architecture (AWS Serverless)

The system is built using a scalable, cloud-native AWS architecture:

- Amazon API Gateway  
- AWS Lambda  
- Amazon DynamoDB  
- Amazon Cognito  
- Amazon S3  
- Amazon CloudWatch  
- Amazon Bedrock / OpenAI API  

### High-Level Flow
User → API Gateway → Serverless Microservices (Tutor, Code Assistant, Progress Tracker) → DynamoDB → AI Engine
